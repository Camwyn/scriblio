Scriblio enables faceted searching and browsing of WordPress posts, pages, and custom post types. 

== Description ==

Scriblio enables faceted searching and browsing of WordPress posts, pages, and custom post types. Tags and other taxonomies are represented as clickable facets that you can use to explore a site.

Scriblio was originally built for libraries and once known as <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/11133/">WPopac</a>. Early support was given by <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/">Plymouth State University</a> and the <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Download and activate the plugin.
1. Put the widgets into sidebars that are active on your site's search, tag and category archives, and other archive pages.
1. Do a search or click a tag on your site, then click the facets to go further.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example search/browse display showing facet clouds, search autocompletion, editable search breadcrumbs, and microformatted record display.
